# ClickNeko

ClickNeko is a safe, pastel-themed macro clicker created for gamers, learners, and anyone looking for a simple, open-source automation tool.  
Built with clean Python code, it offers customizable settings and an easy-to-use interface.

## Features

- Toggle mode or hold-to-click operation
- Pattern-based clicking (click, hold, pause, release)
- Humanized delay option to simulate real clicking
- Sound support for custom click effects (.wav files)
- Friendly, soft-themed graphical interface
- Fully open-source and beginner-friendly

## Why ClickNeko?

Many macro apps online are bloated or unsafe. ClickNeko was built with security, transparency, and education in mind.  
The code is designed to be simple enough to learn from, and safe enough to trust.
